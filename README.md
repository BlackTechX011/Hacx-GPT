## :star2: About The Project

HacxGPT is designed to provide powerful, unrestricted, and seamless AI-driven conversations, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with natural language processing.

### :grey_question: What is this Repository?

This repository is an advanced open-source interface framework designed to unlock **uncensored AI capabilities** through **extensive jailbreaking**. This repository serves as a professional bridge for interfacing both standard language models and our **proprietary neural engine**, providing a specialized framework for unrestricted data generation and security research.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HacxGPT utilizes an advanced, extensive system prompt architecture engineered to provide superior, uncensored results. This specialized jailbreak framework ensures that the AI operates without standard behavioral constraints, delivering precise and unfiltered data tailored for technical and security exploration.

**It is important to understand:** This code is a wrapper and a proof-of-concept, not the core, fine-tuned HacxGPT model itself.

### :gem: HacxGPT Premier: Proprietary Neural Engine

While this repository offers a glimpse into HacxGPT's potential, our flagship offering is a **custom-engineered, proprietary neural architecture.**

Why Choose Our Proprietary Engine?

- **Superior Performance:** Our proprietary architecture is significantly more intelligent, coherent, and capable than what can be achieved with a simple system prompt on a public API.
- **Enhanced Security & Data Integrity:** Available as a secure, managed enterprise service to ensure maximum protection and prevent unauthorized usage.
- **True Unrestricted Power:** Built from the ground up to handle complex, high-stakes tasks without the constraints of public-facing models.

#### Accessing the Proprietary Engine

Access to the HacxGPT proprietary core is highly exclusive. To inquire about dedicated services and institutional licensing, please contact our team via Telegram.

➡️ **Join our Telegram Channel for more info:** [https://t.me/HacxGPT](https://t.me/HacxGPT)

## :dart: Features

- **Powerful AI Conversations:** Get intelligent and context-aware answers to your queries.
- **Extensive Model Support:** Access to **HacxGPT Proprietary Engines**, specialized **Groq models**, and a vast library of **Open Source FREE models** via OpenRouter.
- **Unrestricted Framework:** A system prompt designed to bypass conventional AI limitations.
- **Easy-to-Use CLI:** A clean and simple command-line interface for smooth interaction.
- **Cross-Platform:** Tested and working on Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Termux.

## :electric_plug: Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the HacxGPT framework running on your system.

### :key: Prerequisites: API Key

To use this framework, you **must** obtain an API key from a supported provider.

1.  **Choose a provider:**
    *   **HacxGPT:** Visit [HacxGPT Telegram](https://t.me/HacxGPT) to get a global API key.
    *   **OpenRouter:** Visit [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys) to get an API key.

2.  **Copy your API key.** You will need to paste it into the script when prompted during the first run.

### :gear: Installation

We provide simple, one-command installation scripts for your convenience.

#### **Windows**
1. Download the `install.bat` script from this repository.
2. Double-click the file to run it. It will automatically clone the repository and install all dependencies.

#### **Linux / Termux**
1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command. It will download the installer, make it executable, and run it for you.
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlackTechX011/Hacx-GPT/main/scripts/install.sh)
   ```

<details>
<summary>Manual Installation (Alternative)</summary>

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BlackTechX011/Hacx-GPT.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Hacx-GPT
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    pip install -e .
    ```
</details>

---

## :wrench: Configuration

HacxGPT uses a centralized `providers.json` for managing API endpoints and models. You can easily switch between providers and models using the built-in commands or through the setup menu.

1.  **Launch the tool:** `python -m hacxgpt.main`
2.  **Select Option [2]** to Configure Security Keys.
3.  **Choose your provider** and select your **preferred model** from the interactive list.

### ⌨️ Commands

While in chat, use these commands to dynamically update your uplink:
- `/setup` - Re-configure API keys and default models.
- `/provider <name>` - Switch between configured providers.
- `/model <name>` - Switch the active model.
- `/models` - List available models for your current provider.
- `/status` - Show current uplink configuration.

---

## :eyes: Usage


Run the application directly:

```bash
hacxgpt
# OR
python -m hacxgpt.main
```

The first time you run it, you will be prompted to enter your API key. It will be saved locally for future sessions.
